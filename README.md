# LLM_Lllama2

## This is a local implementation of Generative AI using ChainLit for creating an application interface, Langchain for tools for chainig prompts and Llama-2 7B Chat model.
I have added custom pdf (my subject's book pdf) to try out , we can further add custom pdfs by PyPDFLoader
But can also use other "Unstructured Datasets" in future

The chainlit interface starts but my system shows an error of **<"Could not import sentence_transformers python package. Please install it with pip install sentence_transformers.">**

## Methods to Run on local Comp
- Copy Code in VsCode or other Python IDE
- Change "DATA_PATH" to custom data (pdf)
- Change "model" in llmloader() func to data's loaction in device

  ### That's it, you can try now !
